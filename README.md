# ADHD SS Extension

## Overview

The **ADHD SS Extension** is a Chrome extension designed to help students with ADHD, ADD, or short attention spans stay focused while studying. Inspired by the popular TikTok trend of pairing study content with a Subway Surfers video in the background, this extension plays a looped Subway Surfers video in a resizable and draggable window on any webpage. The video acts as a secondary stimulus, helping users maintain focus on their primary task.

The extension is currently under review by the Chrome Web Store review team. In the meantime, you can load and use the unpacked version on your personal computer.

## How It Works

The extension injects a video player into every webpage you visit. The video player is styled to look like a phone screen and can be moved and resized to fit your needs. The video is muted by default to avoid distractions.
